  version: 1.0.0
  description: >
    Open and vendor-neutral HTTPS/JSON API between a self-service waste compactor and a backend system.
    The direction of the API is compactor→backend, where compactor acts as a client and backend acts as a server.
    Security model is based on mutual TLS (mTLS) where both sides prove their identity by using X.509 certificates.
